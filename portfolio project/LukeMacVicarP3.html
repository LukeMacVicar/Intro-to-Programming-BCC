<h1>Intrests</h1>
<p>My passion in this life is to create things and to fix things. I have spent my whole life figuring out how everything around me works and how to make it better. I learn best from videos and just being hands on with what I am working on. I like to test all possiblities and figure out the best way to do what I am doing. I learn by doing and failing. I benefit from every type of learning and I use each of them to figure out what works best for the particular sitiation.
